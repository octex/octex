## Hi there 👋

I'm octi. I love videogames programming and I'm currently working on something. I have experience as QA and backend development. Nowdays I'm mainly coding on Python but I find always interesting to experiment with different languages all the time :)

Feel free to use any repo that you may find useful! ᕕ(⌐■_■)ᕗ ♪♬
